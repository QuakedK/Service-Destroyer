# Service Destroyer
Service Destroyer is specifically designed to disable system services, it doesn't target debloating windows like [Oneclick](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick) or using NSudo to disable additional services like [Process Destroyer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer). Meaning it may not be as effective as Oneclick or Process Destroyer, however it disables as much services as possible before reaching that absurd level.
