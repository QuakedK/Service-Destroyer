# Service Destroyer
Service Destroyer is specifically designed to disable system services, it doesn't target debloating windows like [Oneclick](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick) or using NSudo to disable additional services like [Process Destroyer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer). Meaning it may not be as effective as Oneclick or Process Destroyer, however it disables as much services as possible before reaching that absurd level. You can find additional info here -> [Extra Info](https://github.com/QuakedK/Service-Destroyer/edit/main/README.md#4-extra-info)

# #1 Usage
> [!NOTE]
> Service Destroyer provides full support for Windows 11, results may differ on older windows versions.

[Service Destroyer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Service-Destroyer/releases/download/ServiceDisabler/Service-Destroyer-V1.3.bat) | 
The **Regular Version** disables all services, preventing a tons of services from automatically starting, this a great utility for those who simply want to target services! However because a ton of services are disabled, features and functionality is obviously lost. Please Check and read the [Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Service-Destroyer/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md).

[Service Destroyer Lite](https://github.com/QuakedK/Service-Destroyer/releases/download/ServiceDisabler/Service-Destroyer-Lite-V1.3.bat) |
The **Lite Version** sets all services to manual preventing most services from automatically starting. This a great and simple this is a great alternative for those who don't want to lose functionality or deal with unsupport features.

1. Download and choose your [Service Destroyer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Service-Destroyer/releases/tag/ServiceDisabler) version.
2. Right-click & run it as admin!

# #2 Revert
Note: If you created a Restore Point you can just use that <3

**Reg Backup**
1. Open CMD and paste the following then restart.
```bat
:: Revert Services.
reg import "C:\Service Destroyer\Reg Backup\ServicesBackup.reg"

:: Revert SvcHostThreshold.
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control" /v SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB /t REG_DWORD /d 3670016 /f
```
> [!NOTE]
> The reg import command will provide an error, but thats because the Service Destroyer backs up all of the services keys.
> You won't have sufficient to restore some of the keys hence the error, but the services the program disabled can be restored without problem.
> Simply ignore the error as the keys you care about should've imported/reverted back to normal!

# #4 Extra Info

**Services that didn't make the cut**:
```
1. Udk User Service.
Udk User Service slows down searching to a horrible degree, therefore left it's unchanged.

2. Time Broker Service.
When TimeBokerSvc is disabled Task Scheduler breaks, therefore left it's unchanged.

3. CNG Key Isolation Service
When KeyIso is disabled on a Online/Micsoft install of windows it gives PIN unavailable issue. Therefore it's left unchanged!

4. Microsoft Passport Service
When NgcSvc is disabled on a Online/Micsoft install of windows it gives a blank logon. Therefore it's left unchanged!

5. Microsoft Passport Container Service
When NgcCtnrSvc is disabled on a Online/Micsoft install of windows it gives a blank logon. Therefore it's left unchanged!

6. Application Information
When Appinfo is can't request admin permissions meaning you can't open apps that request administrator.
However the work around was just to disable UAC but some people will enable it cauing issues

7. Other Services...
Service Destroyer does not use NSudo so for services that need trusted installer privileges to be disabled aren't touched.
```

**Cryptographic Service**:
```
CryptSvc checks digital signatures of Windows files, manages root certificates, etc.
Windows protects this service with WRP (Windows Resource Protection), so it canâ€™t easily be removed or disabled.
However deleting in the registry works!

:: Delete CryptSvc
reg delete "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CryptSvc" /f
```
