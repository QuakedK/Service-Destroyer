Service Destroyer disables Bluetooth, but most Bluetooth devices with usb dongles allow for use and connection even after Service Destroyer. If your device has no dongle and requires full wireless connection I would not recommend using Service Destroyer.

Service Destroyer disables Wifi, but it can simply be turned on by running the [Wifi Fixer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Turn%20On%20Wifi.bat) here!
